Peovle
</h1>

Peovle is an organization for learning PHP and its powerfull framework Laravel. Starting from scratch, you will see 
the basics of PHP developing and **core PHP** codes, continuing to **MVC** architecture and **PHP/Laravel** framework.
I build these projects myself when I was at PHP/Laravel bootcamp in _Maktab Sharif_.

It is a good repository to learn the concepts of Backend developing and PHP developing.
